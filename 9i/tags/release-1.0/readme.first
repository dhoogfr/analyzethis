AnalyzeThis is a pl/sql application that helps you in managing the cbo statistics for your database.
It does this by allowing you to store the dbms_stats parameters into a table, enabling the use of default settings on different levels. 
You can, for instance, spefify a set of parameters to be used for all partitions of a table and then make an exception for one speficif partition.

AnalyzeThis keeps also track of the old cbo statistics in a history table (together with which parameters where being used to gather these statistics) 
and keep track of the time it took to analyze an object.
